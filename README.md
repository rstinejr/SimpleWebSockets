# SimpleWebSockets
Minimal example of WebSockets in .NET Core

This project lays out a minimal client and server that illustrate the use of WebSockets
in .NET Core. It borrows heavily from the AspNet GitHup project
[EchoApp](web site https://github.com/aspnet/WebSockets/tree/dev/samples/EchoApp) and
blog post
[NET 4.5 WebSocket client without a browser](http://itq.nl/net-4-5-websocket-client-without-a-browser/).
